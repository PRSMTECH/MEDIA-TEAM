## Content Production Workflow

### Daily Routine (Stream Days)
```
1. Pre-stream (1 hr before)
   └── Post "going live" on all platforms

2. During stream
   └── Jordan streams, Hafiz monitors for clip moments

3. Post-stream (within 2 hours)
   ├── Download VOD
   ├── Clip 3-5 highlights
   ├── Post best clip to TikTok
   └── Tweet key takeaway
```

### Daily Routine (Non-Stream Days)
```
1. Morning (30 min)
   ├── Reply to all comments
   ├── 5 engagement actions on X
   └── 5 engagement actions on Instagram

2. Content Block (1-2 hours)
   ├── Edit 1 piece of content
   └── Queue for posting

3. Evening (15 min)
   ├── 2-3 Reddit comments
   └── Review analytics
```
