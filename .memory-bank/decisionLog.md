## 2026-01-12 - Workspace Structure Decision

**Decision**: Use weekly folder structure with daily subfolders and role-based organization

**Context**: Need to organize media production deliverables for tracking

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Flat structure with date prefixes - rejected (hard to navigate)
2. Project-based folders - rejected (content is ongoing, not project-based)
3. Weekly → Daily → Role structure - **SELECTED**

**Rationale**:
- Matches natural production cadence (weekly goals, daily tasks)
- Easy to track weekly output
- Role subfolders (CEO, HAFIZ, SHARED) prevent confusion

**Impact**: All team members should follow WEEK-X/DATE/ROLE pattern

## 2026-01-12 - Hafiz Task Prioritization

**Decision**: Initial focus on CapCut clips and Vibe Coder skits

**Context**: Need to define Week 1 priorities for new hire

**Rationale**:
1. CapCut clips already exist - quick wins
2. Vibe Coder skits have ready scripts - low barrier
3. NX Studio is Prajj's assignment - parallel track
4. Build confidence before complex client work

**Impact**: Week 1 deliverables focused on content production, not client design
